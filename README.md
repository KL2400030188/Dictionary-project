Dictionary project using linked List
Project Title: Dictionary Using Linked List
Description:
This project implements a dictionary using a linked list, allowing dynamic storage and efficient management of words and their meanings. The dictionary supports four main operations. First, Adding Words, where new words along with their meanings can be inserted into the linked list in an ordered manner. Second, Searching Words, which enables a user to look up a word, and the system returns its meaning if found. Third, Displaying the Dictionary, where all stored words and their meanings are presented in alphabetical order. Lastly, Deleting Words, which allows users to remove a word from the dictionary, ensuring efficient memory management. This approach provides a structured and flexible way to handle dictionary operations, demonstrating the effectiveness of linked lists in real-world applications.
